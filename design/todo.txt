Enhance

Core Experience

Integrate ROM scanning from active RetroArch directories so the app can flag “installed vs missing” directly in the explorer table. Tie it to storage_config paths and surface counts per console.
Offer per-console “Launch in RetroArch” by writing .m3u playlists or invoking the CLI with the matching core (cores.json already links BIOS requirements).
Add a “Verify ROM” action that hashes local files and cross-checks against the libretro RDB entry; highlight mismatches and offer auto-renaming to the canonical title.
Metadata & Automation

Cache RDB snapshots by GUID/version and expose a diff view so users can see what changed after re-export (new games, metadata updates).
Build a provider coverage dashboard: for each console show RDB total vs provider total vs downloaded. Use it to recommend additional providers when gaps exist (e.g., “missing JP set, add provider X”).
Extend BIOS handling with core-specific instructions—auto-create missing directories, compress BIOS zips, and add a scheduled re-check to warn when user paths lose files.
Exploration & UX

Add advanced filters in explorer (region, genre, release year) using the RDB metadata already stored. Quick toggles (US-only, prototypes, etc.) help locate specific builds fast.
Provide bulk actions: queue/download entire region sets, export CSV/JSON snapshots, generate .lpl playlists, and sync selection to devices (Steam Deck, SD cards) via rsync.
Enhance global search with fuzzy matching and favorites; a user could star their top ROMs and keep them pinned across consoles.
Reliability & Tooling

Persist column widths and view preferences per user (simple JSON) instead of requiring code changes.
Run background tasks (provider parsing, RDB export) asynchronously with progress bars/toasts, so the TUI stays responsive.
Add logging + error capture (file + screen) to troubleshoot provider failures or download issues; expose a “Report issue” action that bundles recent logs.
Future Integrations

Hook into RetroAchievements (if user enables API key) to annotate ROMs with badge counts, hardcore/completion status.
Offer artwork scraping parity: download snapshots, manuals, and per-game description and show them in the detail modal.
Provide a scripting hook (maybe YAML recipes) so power users can define pipelines (e.g., “for Saturn, download RDB, compare provider, queue missing, convert CHD”).
